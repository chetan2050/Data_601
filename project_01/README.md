The project is about 'analyzing the meteorological variables and precipitation patterns in the Amazon Rainforest.
The data was collected from https://adc.arm.gov/discovery/#/results/s::mao. This is the value-added product data for the GoAmazon2014/15 period at the location T3 site.
I downloaded the armbeatm data for 2014 and 2015 separately in CSV format and later merged it into single data using Python. By using this data, we can analyze the relationship between meteorological surface variables with precipitation pattern in the Amazon rainforest, which could be a useful analysis to validate the weather and climate model and also for visitors who wants to explore the Amazon rainforest, to get information about appropriate weather.
